  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/banners/ironing_bg.png
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/animations/
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SF Pro Display
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SFPRODISPLAYREGULAR.otf
          weight: 400 # Normal/Regular

          weight: 700 # Bold
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
