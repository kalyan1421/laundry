# 📱 iOS Deployment Target Fixed

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

**Problems**: 
1. First: `cloud_firestore` required iOS 13.0 (app was targeting iOS 12.0)
2. Second: `google_maps_flutter_ios` required iOS 14.0 (after setting to 13.0)

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Updated Podfile**
**File**: `customer_app/ios/Podfile`
```diff
# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
- # platform :ios, '12.0'
+ platform :ios, '14.0'
```

### **2. Updated Xcode Project Settings**
**File**: `customer_app/ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`

Updated all 3 occurrences of `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`:
```diff
- IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 12.0;  # Initial
- IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.0;  # First fix for cloud_firestore
+ IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 14.0;  # Final fix for google_maps_flutter_ios
```

**Configurations Updated**:
- Debug configuration
- Profile configuration  
- Release configuration

### **3. Cleaned Build Cache**
- Removed `ios/Pods` directory (twice)
- Removed `ios/Podfile.lock` (twice)
- Ran `flutter clean` (twice)
- Ran `flutter pub get` (twice)
