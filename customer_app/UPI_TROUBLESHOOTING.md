# 🔧 UPI Payment Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **Good News: Your UPI System is Working!**

From the logs, I can see:
- ✅ **UPI payment initiated successfully**
- ✅ **PhonePe app opened correctly**  
- ✅ **Transaction ID generated: ORDER_1753819950204**
- ✅ **UPI URL created properly**

## ⚠️ **The Issue: "Please try again after sometimes later"**

This error comes from **PhonePe app**, not your app. Here's how to fix it:

## 🛠️ **Quick Fixes**

### **1. Amount Issue (Most Likely Cause)**
**Problem**: You were testing with ₹1.5 (very small amount)
**Solution**: ✅ **Fixed - Now uses minimum ₹10 for testing**

```dart
// Before: amount: widget.totalAmount*0.01  (₹1.5)
// After:  amount: widget.totalAmount >= 10 ? widget.totalAmount : 10.0  (₹10 minimum)
```

### **2. Verify UPI ID**
**Your UPI ID**: `bhuvanaajan2@oksbi`
**Test it manually**:
- Open Google Pay/PhonePe 
- Send ₹1 to `bhuvanaajan2@oksbi`
- If it fails → UPI ID is inactive

### **3. Try Different UPI Apps**
Instead of PhonePe, try:
- **Google Pay** (most reliable)
- **Paytm**
- **BHIM UPI**

### **4. PhonePe Server Issues**
Sometimes PhonePe servers are busy:
- Wait 10-15 minutes
- Try during non-peak hours
- Check PhonePe app updates

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test with Higher Amount**
```
1. Install updated app
2. Go to payment flow
3. Should now show ₹10 minimum (not ₹1.5)
4. Try payment
```

### **Step 2: Manual UPI ID Test**
```
1. Open your UPI app
2. Send ₹1 to bhuvanaajan2@oksbi
3. If success → UPI ID is active
4. If fails → Contact SBI to activate UPI
```

### **Step 3: Check SBI Account**
```
1. Login to SBI online banking
2. Check if UPI is enabled
3. Verify account is active
4. Check daily UPI limits
```

## 📱 **What the Logs Show**
